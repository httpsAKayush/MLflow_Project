# Notes on MLflow Tracking
`mlflow.set_tracking_url()` coneects to a tracking URI. You can also set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variavle to have MLflow find a URI from there. In both casis, the URI can either be a HTTP/HTTPS URI for a remote server, a database connection string, or a local path to log fata to directory. The URI defaults to mlruns.

`mlflow.get_tracking_uri()` returns the current tracking URI.

`mlflow.create_experiment()` creates a new experiment and returns its ID. Runs can be launched under the experiment by passing the experiment ID to mlflow.start_run.

`mlflow.set_experiment()` sets ans experinment as active, If the experiment does not exist, creates a new experiment. If you do not specigy an experiment in mlflow.start_run(), new runs are launched under this experiment.

`mlflow.start_run()` returns the currently active run (if one exists), or starts a new run and returns a mlflow.ActiveRun object usable as a context manager for the current run. You do not need to call start_run explicitly: calling one of the logging functions with no active run automatically starts a new one.

`mlflow.end_run()` ends the currently active run, if any, taking an optional run status

`mlflow.log_param()` logs a single key-value param in the active run. The key and value are voth strings. Use mlflow.log_params() to log multiple params at once.

`mlflow.log_metric()` sets a single key-value metric. The value must always be a number. MLflow remembers the history of values for each metric. Use mlflow.log_metric() to log multiple metrics at once.

`mlfloe.set_tag()` sets a single key-value tag in the currently active run. The key and value are both strings. Use mlflow.set_tags() to set multiple tags at once.

`mlflow.log_artifact()` logs a local file or directory as an artifact, optionally taking an artifact_path to place it in within the run's artifact URI. Run artifacts can be organized into directories, so you can place the artifact in a directory this way.

`mlflow.log_artifacts()` logs all the files in a given directory as artifacts, again taking an optional artifact path.
